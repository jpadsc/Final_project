    <h1>Mission Impossible: Finding a Sleeping Position That Doesnâ€™t Hurt</h1>
    <h4>DSC 106 final project by Javier Ponce</h4>
    <p>
        Have you ever woken up feeling worse than before you went to bed? 
        If you said yes, you might have a bad sleeping posture. 
        In the following project, I use visualizations to explain key ideas 
        of how to sleep better while trying to find the overall best sleeping position. 
    </p>
    <h3>Bad news for stomach sleepers</h3>
    <p>If you are like me and enjoy sleeping in your stomach, then I have bad news for you. 
        The conductors of the experiment I pulled my data from decided to not include data 
        for subjects sleeping on their stomachs. But even worse, stomach sleeping is widely 
        considered to be the worst sleeping position so it is reasonable to ignore it when 
        trying to find the best sleeping position. If you are a stomach sleeper, 
        I hope this project encourages you to try some new sleeping positions, just 
        like it encouraged me. 
    </p>
    <h3>First visualization</h3>
    <p>
        In the visualization below we explore how different sleeping positions 
        affect the distribution of pressure over the body of the subjects. 
        The visualization allows you to navigate between 8 subjects and 16 sleeping positions, 
        once a configuration is chosen you see the pressure distributed over the mattress 
        (and the subjects body), highliting with blue the points with the highest pressure.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p>
        While exploring this visualization, you should be able to notice 
        that all individuals registered less pressure when they were centered 
        compared to when they were near the end of the bed or with a diagonal 
        orientation. Another easy-to-infer finding is that heavier subjects 
        do not necessarily exert more pressure. In reality, what matters the 
        most is the comparison between their mass (weight) and the area of 
        their side touching the mattress. For the same reason, we see a lot 
        more blue when subjects sleep sideways since it reduces their area 
        touching the mattress by half.
    </p>

    <h2>Pillow talk: Let's talk about pillows</h2>
    <p>
        Do the findings from the first visualization imply that sleeping on your side is bad? 
        Not at all. Side sleeping has many benefits. 
        The only thing that our previous visualization showed is that side sleeping is worse 
        for distributing your weight around your body. Thankfully for us, pillows exist.
    </p>
    <h3>Second visualization</h3>
    <p>
        In this visualization, we explore how using supporting pillows can improve side sleeping.
         The visualization uses an interactive interface similar to the one from the first visualization. 
         The main difference being that we only consider side sleeping and we select between different 
         pillow configurations rather than sleeping positions.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p>
        The main takeaway is that pillows and sleeping wedges can significatlly improve side sleeping and what better
        way to show this than a visualization.

    <h2>From the inclined plane to an inclined bed</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone who has taken a physics class knows that inclination 
        matters when considering the force between an object and the 
        inclined surface. Then, Could we use inclination to improve sleeping?

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p>
        While the inclination is helpful in multiple situations, like trying to stimulate blood circulation, 
        this visualization shows that inclination is not as helpful when trying to distribute pressure over the mattress. In fact, 
        too much inclination seems to be bad for pressure distribution, showing significantly more blue for each subject.

    <!-- <p>So far, I've extracted the data for one subject for all supine positions and created the matress mapping that you are currently seeing
        I also had to implemented the selector for all these 10 different positions, plus I took the time to explore the data, in order to 
        understand the best default position (#2 not #1).All the data came as matrices in txt files so I had to convert those into js objects
        then I made a grid with the same dimessions of the matrices and mapped each square to a matrix entry, then the hardest part was finding
        how to make it so that the numbers where mapped to a color scale, I am still unsure about the current color scale but it is the best one 
        I've tried so far.

        Now in terms of what I am yet to do I plan to add other subjects to the graph and instead of filtering them by name (like subject 1), 
        I'll do it by weight so that the reader can easily compare different weights and also choose someone with a weight closer to theirs. 
       I think the hardest part of this is going to be working with so much data and finding a way to implement it on my graph without having 
       to explicitly read each file, Additionally I am thinking of adding an additional mapping that is not of the matress preassure but of the 
       siluete of a human higlinting the areas that are carrying the weight , I do not know how to approach this idea but it would be super cool 
       so if I do it it woudl be the hardest thing (I think).
