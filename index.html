    <p>So far, I've extracted the data for one subject for all supine positions and created the matress mapping that you are currently seeing
        I also had to implemented the selector for all these 10 different positions, plus I took the time to explore the data, in order to 
        understand the best default position (#2 not #1).All the data came as matrices in txt files so I had to convert those into js objects
        then I made a grid with the same dimessions of the matrices and mapped each square to a matrix entry, then the hardest part was finding
        how to make it so that the numbers where mapped to a color scale, I am still unsure about the current color scale but it is the best one 
        I've tried so far.

        Now in terms of what I am yet to do I plan to add other subjects to the graph and instead of filtering them by name (like subject 1), 
        I'll do it by weight so that the reader can easily compare different weights and also choose someone with a weight closer to theirs. 
       I think the hardest part of this is going to be working with so much data and finding a way to implement it on my graph without having 
       to explicitly read each file, Additionally I am thinking of adding an additional mapping that is not of the matress preassure but of the 
       siluete of a human higlinting the areas that are carrying the weight , I do not know how to approach this idea but it would be super cool 
       so if I do it it woudl be the hardest thing (I think).
